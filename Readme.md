# Age and Gender Detection Using OpenCV  

This Python project detects human faces in real-time, estimates their gender, and predicts their age range using pre-trained deep learning models.  

## Features  
- Detects faces in video streams using OpenCV's deep learning module.  
- Predicts gender (Male/Female).  
- Estimates age group from a pre-defined range (e.g., 0-2, 4-7, etc.).  

---

## Prerequisites  

Ensure you have the following installed:  
- Python 3.7 or later  
- OpenCV (`cv2`)  
- Pre-trained models for face detection, gender prediction, and age estimation:  
  - `opencv_face_detector.pbtxt`  
  - `opencv_face_detector_uint8.pb`  
  - `age_deploy.prototxt`  
  - `age_net.caffemodel`  
  - `gender_deploy.prototxt`  
  - `gender_net.caffemodel`

## Installation  

1. Clone this repository or download the code files.  
2. Install the required dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python opencv-python-headless
   ```  
3. Download the required pre-trained models from reliable sources or include them in the same directory.  

---

## Usage  

1. Place the pre-trained model files in the project directory.  
2. Run the script:  
   ```bash
   python age_gender_detection.py
   ```  
3. A live video feed will appear. The application will:  
   - Draw rectangles around detected faces.  
   - Display the predicted age and gender above the detected faces.  

4. Press **`q`** to quit the application.

## How It Works  

1. **Face Detection**  
   - The `faceBox` function uses OpenCV's deep neural network (DNN) module to detect faces in the video feed.  

2. **Gender Prediction**  
   - A deep learning model predicts the gender using the cropped face region as input.  

3. **Age Estimation**  
   - Another model estimates the age group of the person based on the face region.  

4. **Display Results**  
   - Detected faces are highlighted with bounding boxes, and predictions are displayed as labels above the boxes.  

---

## Output Example  
- The output displays a live video feed with labeled bounding boxes:  
  - **Gender:** Male/Female  
  - **Age Range:** (e.g., 20-29, 32-43)  

---

## Notes  
- Adjust the confidence threshold in the `faceBox` function for better accuracy.  
- The model's predictions may not always be 100% accurate. Consider fine-tuning for specific use cases.  

---

## Dependencies  
- OpenCV  
- Pre-trained models for face detection, age, and gender prediction.  

---

## Future Improvements  
- Enhance model accuracy using custom training datasets.  
- Add emotion detection as a feature.  
- Support for processing recorded video files.
